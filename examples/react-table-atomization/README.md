# Reatom atomization example

An example showing how to use the [atomization](https://www.reatom.dev/recipes/atomization/) pattern in Reatom.

[Open in StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/artalar/reatom/tree/v3/examples/react-table-atomization)

There are four examples, each an improved version of the previous one.

## useState

Most basic example with only React features. It took a lot of CPU time and has a huge input lag. The serialization logic is pretty simple, but not safe.

## Reatom

Not very different example from the classic `useState`

## Atomization

## ZodAtomization
