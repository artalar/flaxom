## Creating an issue

Before creating an issue please ensure that the problem is not [already reported](https://github.com/artalar/reatom/issues).

If you want to report a bug, create a reproduction using StackBlitz or CodeSandbox. If you want to request a feature, add motivation section and some usage examples.

## Sending a Pull Request

1. fork and clone the repository
2. create a development branch from `v3` 
3. install dependencies from the root of the repo (`node@18` and `npm@8` are required):
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
   Dependencies are installed for all packages, but only packages included in `@reatom/framework` (`core`, `utils`, `async` etc.) are built.
4. build the package you are editing from the root of the repo:
   ```sh
   npx turbo run build --filter=<PACKAGE_NAME>
   ```
   Replace `<PACKAGE_NAME>` with the relevant package name like `persist` or `npm-react`
5. [make changes](#coding-guide) and [commit them](#commit-messages)
6. upload feature branch and create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/artalar/reatom/compare) to merge changes to `v3`
7. link your PR to the issue using [keyword](https://help.github.com/en/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords) or provide description with motivation and explanation in the comment (example: `fix #74`)
8. wait until a team member responds

## Creating a package

The goal of Reatom ecosystem is to provide adapters for Web APIs and popular npm modules. Therefore, the process of creating a new package is almost identical to editing an existing one ([Sending a Pull Request](#sending-a-pull-request)) with

```sh
npm run package-generator
```

After running the script, edit `author` field and add yourself to `maintainers` of the newly-created `package.json`.

Add needed dependencies by running `npm install` in your package's directory. If you're making an adapter for a particular npm library (like `@reatom/npm-react` for React), the library should be saved as peer: `npm install --save-peer <LIBRARY>`

<!-- To add dependencies, add them manually to the `package.json` of the new package and install them from the root of the repo. -->

### Package naming rule

## Coding guide

- bug fixes should also add tests that reproduce the addressed bug
- all new features should be tested and documented
<!-- - always use `@ts-expect-error` instead of `@ts-ignore` -->
- use `// @ts-ignore` if you not sure why error appears or you think it could be better, use `// @ts-expect-error` if you sure that error is a mistake <!-- ??? -->

## Commit messages

Commit messages should follow the [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
```

### Allowed `<type>`

<!-- - `chore`: ??? -->
- `feat`: code change that adds a new feature
- `fix`: bug fix
- `refactor`: code change that is neither a bug fix nor a feature addition
- `docs`: documentation only changes
- `perf`: code change that improves performance
- `ci`: a change made to CI configurations and scripts
- `style`: cosmetic code changes
- `test`: change that only adds or corrects tests
- `revert`: change

### Allowed `<scope>`

Name of the package from `/packages/<scope>`

### `<description>` rules

- should be written in English
- should be in imperative form (like `change` instead `changed` or `changes`)
- should not be capitalized
- should not have period at the end

### Commit message examples

```
docs: fix typo in npm-react
fix(core): add check for atoms with equal ids
```
