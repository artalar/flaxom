# Inversion of control

## Explanation

[Inversion of control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control) is a concept for changing some dependency based on the running context - most popular reason for that is tasting. Good for Reatom users - all basic entities (actions, atoms) are already working in a controlled context - store. By the same token, any atom dependency (as another atom) will be automatically added to a store when the computed atom will be connected to it. That means that you already have a dependency resolution mechanism with Reatom.

What does it mean in conclusion? You can create not only reactive atoms (depended on actions) but just _static_ atoms and use it as a service.

## Example

> IMPORTANT NOTE: in order to prevent errors in serialization **use a symbol** as an atom key

```ts
/* DECLARE API SERVICE */

import { declareAtom, declareAction, createStore } from '@reatom/core'
import axios from 'axios'

export const API = Symbol('api')
export const apiAtom = declareAtom(API, axios, () => [])

/* FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION */

export const recieveData = declareAction()
export const requestData = declareAction(async (payload, store) => {
  const data = await store.getState(apiAtom).get(url, payload)
  store.dispach(recieveData(data))
})

/* FEATURE USAGE */

store.dispatch(requestData())

/* TESTS */

// here we rewrite the initial state (axios) of apiAtom with a preloaded state
const store = createStore({
  [API]: mockedAxiosInstance,
})
```
