# Contributing

[Reatom](https://github.com/artalar/reatom) is open source state manager for small and complex applications.

If you want to contribute to improving the library, use the following instructions to create changes:

- [Creating an issue](#creating-an-issue)
- [Sending a Pull Request](#sending-a-pull-request)

> **Note:** Languages other than English are not normally used in issue or commits descriptions.

## Creating an issue

If you found a bug or want to make an improvement in the library please check whether the same issue already exists in the [list of issues](https://github.com/artalar/reatom/issues). If you don't find the issue there, [create a new one](https://github.com/artalar/reatom/issues/new) including a description of the problem.

## Sending a Pull Request

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone the fork.

   ```bash
   $ git clone git@github.com:<username>/reatom.git
   ```

3. Add the main repository for the `reatom` library as a remote repository with the name "upstream".

   ```bash
   $ cd reatom
   $ git remote add upstream git@github.com:artalar/reatom.git
   ```

4. Install dependencies for development.

   ```bash
   $ npm i
   ```

5. Fetch the latest changes.

   ```bash
   $ git fetch upstream
   ```

6. Create a `feature-branch` from `next` branch that includes the number of the [created issue](#creating-an-issue).

   ```bash
   $ git checkout upstream/next
   $ git checkout -b issue-<issue number>
   ```

7. Make changes.
8. Record the changes according to [conventional rules](#commit-rules).

   ```bash
   $ git commit -m "<type>[optional scope]: <description>"
   ```

9. Fetch the latest changes.

   ```bash
   $ git pull --rebase upstream next
   ```

   > **Note:** Repeat this step before every change you make, to be sure that you are working with code that contains the latest updates.

10. Send the changes to GitHub.

    ```bash
    $ git push -u origin issue-<issue number>
    ```

    > **Note**: It is desirable to use **interactive rebase** (`git rebase upstream/next -i`) for cleanup commits list before sending a Pull Request

11. Send a [Pull Request](https://github.com/artalar/reatom/compare) to the `next` branch.
12. Link the Pull Request and issue with [keyword](https://help.github.com/en/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords) in the comment. Example: `fix #74`
13. Wait for a decision about accepting the changes.

## Commit rules
