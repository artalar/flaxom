If you want to contribute to improving the library, use the following instructions to create changes:

> **Note:** we prefer English language for all communication.

## Creating an issue

If you found a bug or want to make an improvement in the library please check whether the same issue already exists in the [list of issues](https://github.com/artalar/reatom/issues). If you don't find the issue there, [create a new one](https://github.com/artalar/reatom/issues/new) including a description of the problem. Note [labels used](#labels-used-in-repository).

## Sending a Pull Request

1. üêô Fork and clone the repository.
2. üóúÔ∏è Install dependencies from the root of the repo, `node@18` and `npm@8` required.
   ```bash
   npm i
   ```
   All needed dependencies for all packages will be installed automatically, but only `@reatom/framework` dependencies (`core`, `utils`, `async` and a few more) will be builded.
3. üî® Build needed package from the root of the repo.
   ```bash
   npx turbo run build --filter=PACKAGE_NAME
   ```
   Replace `PACKAGE_NAME` with the name of the package you want to build. For example, `npm-react` or `persist`. The [turbo](https://turbo.build) will handle all dependencies and build all required graph.
4. üé® Create a `feature-branch` from `v3` branch that starts from the number of the [created issue](#creating-an-issue).
5. üß™ If you want to fix a bug, write reproduction tests first.
6. ü™Ñ Make changes.
7. üß™ If you added a feature, write tests for it.
8. üìù Record the changes according to [conventional rules](#commit-rules).
   ```bash
   $ git commit -m "<type>[optional scope]: <description>"
   ```
9. üíç Send the changes to GitHub and create [Pull Request](https://github.com/artalar/reatom/compare) to the `v3` branch.
10. üîó Link the Pull Request and issue with [keyword](https://help.github.com/en/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords) or provide description with motivation and explanation in the comment. Example: `fix #74`.
11. ‚è≥ Wait for a decision about accepting the changes.

## Create a new package

We want to grow a huge ecosystem of packages for Reatom and made an adapters for most popular web APIs and NPM libraries. If you want to help with it, please follow the instructions of [Sending a Pull Request](#sending-a-pull-request) section, but on the third step you should add a new package to the `packages` directory We have a handy generator for it, run the following command from the root of the repo and follow the displayed instructions.

```bash
npm run package-generator
```

Edit the `author` field and add yourself to the `maintainers` list of the `package.json` of the new package.

If you need to add dependencies, add them manually to the `package.json` of the new package and install them from the root of the repo.

## Codestyle rules

1. use `// @ts-ignore` if you not sure why error appears or you think it could be better, use `// @ts-expect-error` if you sure that error is a mistake.

## Commit rules

Record the changes made by making comments in accordance with [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org).

```

## Labels used in repository

Labels are divided in three main categories (label count assignable for one issue/PR):
1. Type (exactly one) -- used to mark issues type
2. Part (at most one) -- used to mark affected project component
3. Meta (any number) -- are used by bots and other functionality

### Type labels
Type labels are prefixed with `T -` and have the following meaning:
- `T - Defect` -- Things are not working in a way they are *meant* to be working. They way they should work are either defined by tests, documentation, reference implementation (for adapter packages), the system design, or common sense. Part label is **mandatory** with this label.
- `T - Proposal` -- Entirely new functionality, package or design approach. Part label **may be skipped**.
- `T - Enhancement` -- There's a way to make something work in a better way in existing functionality, usability improvement, new feature. Part label is **mandatory** with this label.
- `T - Task` -- Some work to do to proceed with other tasks. General for refactoring or chores like releases.

### Part labels
Part labels are prefixed with `P -` and are associated primarily with packages.

Every package published in npm and located in `packages/<package-name>` should have corresponding `P - <package-name>` label.

Special parts are:
- `P - CI` -- CI and repository automation
- `P - Tools` -- Tools used by developers, such as eslint, publishing scripts, etc.
- `P - Docs` -- Documentation website

### Meta labels
- `Hacktoberfest`, `hacktoberfest-accepted` are used to attend [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/).
- `duplicate` is used to mark issues and pull requests that already exist
- `good first issue` is used to mark issues that can be solved by newcommers and are shown at [/contribute](https://github.com/artalar/reatom/contribute) page
- `dependencies` is used by [Dependabot](https://github.com/apps/dependabot)
- `wontfix` this will not be worked on
- `need info` description is partial and describe only the topic
